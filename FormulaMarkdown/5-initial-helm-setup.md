In your workflow, it’s great to see that you're making progress with Minikube, Helm, and Git. To ensure everything is running smoothly and efficiently, here are some questions to ask yourself at various stages of your process:

### **Minikube Setup and Kubernetes Cluster**
1. **Minikube health**:  
   - Is Minikube running without issues? Have I checked the status of all Kubernetes components?
   - Do I need to inspect the logs for potential issues during startup or restarts?
   
2. **Resource management**:  
   - Are enough resources (CPU, memory) allocated to the Minikube cluster?  
   - Is the `docker` driver sufficient for my setup, or do I need to explore other drivers?

3. **Kubernetes services**:  
   - Are all services (like the Prometheus server, etc.) running and accessible from Minikube?  
   - Is `kubectl` properly configured to manage the Minikube cluster?

### **Helm and Prometheus Setup**
4. **Helm repository updates**:  
   - When was the last time I updated the Helm charts? Are there newer stable versions available?
   - Is my current Helm release functioning as expected?

5. **Prometheus configuration**:  
   - Is Prometheus scraping the correct targets? Have I configured it to monitor the desired services?
   - Is Prometheus set up to scale properly with my Minikube cluster, and are there any signs of performance issues?

### **Git and Project Management**
6. **Commit hygiene**:  
   - Are my commit messages clear, concise, and meaningful?  
   - Is the current working tree clean before pushing changes? Am I keeping my commits focused on specific tasks?
   
7. **Collaboration readiness**:  
   - Have I pulled the latest changes before committing to avoid conflicts?
   - Are there any changes from collaborators that I need to review before proceeding with new work?

8. **Kanban board tasks**:  
   - Have the refined task priorities been communicated clearly to the team?  
   - Is my Kanban board up to date with the current project status?

### **General Troubleshooting**
9. **Troubleshooting errors**:  
   - Are there any errors or warnings during the Helm installation or Minikube startup that need my attention?  
   - Have I logged the output from commands for troubleshooting purposes if something fails later?

10. **System resources**:  
   - Is my Codespaces environment handling the workload well, or should I consider adjusting the allocated resources?

By regularly asking these questions, you'll ensure that you're on track, avoiding potential bottlenecks or conflicts. This reflective approach can also help streamline your workflow.
