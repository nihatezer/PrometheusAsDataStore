## Overview

This document outlines the objectives and key results for setting up Prometheus as a data source for Grafana in a Kubernetes environment running on Minikube, within a GitHub Codespaces environment. This setup will allow you to monitor and visualize metrics from Kubernetes services efficiently.

## Objectives

1. **Environment Setup**  
   Set up a Kubernetes environment using Minikube within GitHub Codespaces to create an isolated development and monitoring platform. Minikube will be the local Kubernetes cluster running inside Codespaces.

2. **Prometheus Installation**  
   Install and configure Prometheus within the Minikube environment. Prometheus will scrape metrics from services running in the cluster and serve them as a data source for Grafana.

3. **Grafana Installation**  
   Install Grafana and configure it to interact with Prometheus. Grafana will serve as the dashboard and visualization tool for monitoring the Kubernetes environment.

4. **Data Source Configuration**  
   Configure Prometheus as a data source for Grafana, enabling it to visualize the metrics scraped from the Kubernetes environment.

5. **Monitoring and Visualization**  
   Create custom dashboards in Grafana to visualize key metrics from Prometheus, allowing efficient monitoring and analysis of the Kubernetes services.

## Key Results

- **Minikube Environment**: Successfully deploy and run a Minikube Kubernetes cluster within the GitHub Codespaces environment, providing the foundation for Prometheus and Grafana.
  
- **Prometheus as a Data Source**: Install Prometheus and ensure it is collecting and exposing relevant metrics from Kubernetes services.

- **Grafana Visualization**: Install Grafana and configure it to connect with Prometheus, enabling the visualization of metrics on customized dashboards.

- **Service Accessibility**: Provide access to both Prometheus and Grafana dashboards via URLs that can be opened in a browser.

- **Dashboards Creation**: Create and configure at least one custom dashboard in Grafana using Prometheus metrics, demonstrating the ability to monitor the Kubernetes environment effectively.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the objectives and key results for deploying Prometheus and Grafana in a Minikube Kubernetes cluster running inside GitHub Codespaces. By following the steps described here, you will be able to monitor and visualize Kubernetes metrics effectively, providing insights into your cluster's performance and behavior.
